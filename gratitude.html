    <p>The poem form is a choose-your-own-path poem, a maze poem. The form is inspired by Franny Choi's poem "Never Here" from Choi's collection, <em>Floating,
Brilliant, Gone</em>. Gratitude to Franny Choi.</p>

    <p>Gratitude to <a href="https://www.826michigan.org/">826michigan</a> for allowing me to share the idea of maze poems with young people and to consider the possibilities of how we might share writing digitally.
